# Welcome to my Solution to Assigment Ex1

## in this Assignment we created a Base convertion Calculator for Addition and Multiplication.

Every Number should be in a Template: number_b_base
## for Example: 10 in base 2 would be: 10b2
### 4 in base 6 would be: 4b6
### 100 in base 10 can be: 10bA or just 10

## Example of Output for Inputs: 10b2, 11b2 (2 base 2 and 3 base 2):
### 10b2 + 11b2 = 101b2
### 10b2 * 11b2 = 110b2
### Output Examples for Wrong Input
```java
Ex1 class solution:
Enter a string as number#1 (or "quit" to end the program): 
-5
num2 = -5 is number : false, value: -1
ERR: num1 is in the wrong format! (-5)
```
### Output Examples for Valid Input
```java

Ex1 class solution:
Enter a string as number#1 (or "quit" to end the program): 
100b2
num1 = 100b2 is number : true , value: 4
Enter a string as number#2 (or "quit" to end the program): 
11b2
num2 = 11b2 is number : true, value: 3
Enter a base for Output, [2,16]
10
100b2 + 11b2 = 7b10
100b2 * 11b2 = 12b10
max number over [100b2, 11b2, 7, 12] is 12
```
