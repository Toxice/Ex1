Welcome to my Solution to Assigment Ex1

in this Assignment we created a Base convertion Calculator for Addition and Multiplication.

Every Number should be in a Template: <number>b<base>
for Example: 10 in base 2 would be: 10b2
4 in base 6 would be: 4b6
100 in base 10 can be: 10bA or just 10

Example of Output for Inputs: 10b2, 11b2 (2 base 2 and 3 base 2):
10b2 + 11b2 = 101b2
10b2 * 11b2 = 110b2

101b2 is 5
110b2 is 6
